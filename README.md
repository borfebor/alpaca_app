> An app by [B. Ferrero-Bordera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/borjaferrero/) from [Microbial Proteomics (Uni Greifswald)](https://microbialproteomics.uni-greifswald.de/en/)
## Getting started

Access the GUI in the following link:

### [ðŸ”— alpaca.streamlit.app](https://alpaca.streamlit.app/)

This is a GUI from the Python package [Alpaca_proteomics](https://github.com/borfebor/alpaca_proteomics). The app aims to facilitate the analysis of proteomics samples for Absolute Proteome Quantification based on protein standards.

# Tutorial

## Alpaca GUI tutorial
 
Alpaca is a GUI optimised for the analysis and quantification of proteomics samples using protein standards (e.g., [UPS2](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/DE/en/product/sigma/ups2)). It uses the Python pipeline [Alpaca_proteomics](https://github.com/borfebor/alpaca_proteomics) for quantifying Mass Spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics samples.

### ![Photo 1. Home Page](https://github.com/borfebor/alpaca_app/blob/main/Screenshots/home.png)

When accessing the GUI, a short description of the preferable workflow for the pipeline is shown in the main body. In the side bar, an uploader widget allows the users to import their ProteinGroups. CSV, TXT and Excel files are compatible with the software. Below the widget, different example datasets can be selected to explore the GUI capabilities.

Sample names and replicates for each studied condition are inferred by the software based on the given names during the search on MaxQuant. 

### ![Photo 2. Structure of the GUI](https://github.com/borfebor/alpaca_app/blob/main/Screenshots/structure.png)

After uploading the ProteinGroups file, the GUI changes to the data analysis page. This page consists of two main parts, the body and the sidebar.

- The **GUI sidebar** controls quantification parameters as desired MS intensity method, normalization and protein standards. The sidebar contains 2 main parts (`Data preprocessing` and `Quantification standards`). The desired data processing parameters can be chosen in the `Data preprocessing` section. This includes removal of contaminants, intensity normalization and data formatting. Additionally, the `Quantification standards` section allows to select the used protein standards for quantification and the added amounts. By default, it is set for UPS2, but custom standards can be added).

- The **GUI body** which is divided into 3 parts (`Experimental set-up`, `Data visualization` and `Your data`) allows the user to add details on the experiment and visualize the data. Details on the sample preparation can be added to the `Experimental set-up` tab. Summary statistics of the data and its quantification can be explored in the `Data visualization` tab. Finally, `Your data` corresponds to the quantified proteins in a tabular format ready to be exported.

### Data preprocessing
- **Data cleaning:** If selected, proteins tagged as contaminants, decoys or reverse identifications are removed. It can be selected below which ones to remove or keep if necessary. Enabled by default.
- **Data formatting:** Formats the data for the pipeline calculations. Necessary for the pipeline. If not selected, the data can only be cleaned as specified above and exported. Enabled by default.
- **Label-Free Quantification Method:** The desired intensity-based method can be selected in this tab. The intensity methods shown are based on the ones identified in the provided dataset. By default, iBAQ is selected if it is present in the dataset.
- **Normalization:** Three methods are implemented in Alpaca for intensity normalization. Median, relative and quantile normalization. By default is None.

### Quantification standards

Absolute quantification using Alpaca is optimised for label-free methods, relying on the addition of a set of anchor proteins at a known amount. By default, UPS2 are set as anchor proteins. The user can add custom anchor proteins following the format described in Table 1.

**Table 1.** Format for the file describing the stock solution of anchor proteins.

# GUI body

### Experimental set-up

This tab controls the sample preparation. It is an optional input in case the user wants to trace back to the original amount in the samples, rather than just quantifying what was measured in the Mass Spectrometer.

#### Sample preparation

**Table 2.** Example of the input table to define the parameters used for sample parameters. An example table can be generated in the GUI based on the added conditions. This example table can be exported as a template and edited to be imported later into the GUI.

#### Proteome fraction enrichment (Optional)

In case the sample preparation includes the enrichment of a subproteomic fraction and protein standards have been used to quantify this enrichment step, the standards can be uploaded in this section. As in the sample preparation tab, a template can be generated and downloaded to edit. The GUI accepts the format described in Table 3. 

**Table 3.** Example of the enrichment standards input.

### Data visualization

![Photo 4. Visualization tab](https://github.com/borfebor/alpaca_app/blob/main/Screenshots/viz_option.png)
This tab allows to explore some summary statistics of the data. As it is the number of proteins quantified (`Quantified proteins`) per sample and summary statistics of the measured intensities per sample represented as a boxplot (`intensities`). Additionally, principal component analysis (`PCA`) and intensity distribution (`Distribution plot`) were added to the assessment of the sample quality. The fitting of calibration standards can be visualized in the `Calibration curve`. Finally, a `heatmap` can be drawn and exported if desired.

### Your Data

This section corresponds to the quantified data allowing the user to export it for further analysis. The data is exported as CSV. The data can be pivoted if the export format is not the desired, as by default it specified a row per protein quantified in each sample. Quantified data can also be filtered and sorted to export just a selected set of proteins.
